# Solitaire
 
This is a copy of the game Solitaire made with a custom 2D OpenGL renderer, which is used to test both the renderer and my implementation of a linked list. It currently is fully working, it's playable.

To play you just have to drag the cards with your mouse and use the 'U' key to undo moves. There is no limit to how many moves you can undo.

To compile this code you need to have MinGW installed and run the build.bat file.
