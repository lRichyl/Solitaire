# Solitaire
 
This is a copy of the game Solitaire made with a custom 2D OpenGL renderer, which is used to test both the renderer and my implementation of a linked list. It currently is fully working, it's playable. A few more features will be added like undoing moves and double clicking to add cards to the foundations. 

I considered myself a beginner so this code may not the best but if you're a beginner too you can freely use it for educational purposes.
