# Solitaire
 
This is a copy of the game Solitaire made with a custom 2D OpenGL renderer, which is used to test both the renderer and my implementation of a linked list. It currently is fully working, it's playable. A few more features will be added like undoing moves and double clicking to add cards to the foundations. 

To compile this code you need to have MinGW installed and run the build.bat file.
